**General**:+1: \*_The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren’t perfect. As usual, don’t worry about any of the dynamic functionality on the page or finding the specific icons they use or having the form actually submit. The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can_

**To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.**
